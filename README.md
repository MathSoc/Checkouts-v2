Checkouts 2.0
=============
A rewrite of the MathSOC checkouts system. Less PHP, more features. Why?
Because PHP is ugly, and we have a chance to make the API better, faster,
and easier to maintain or add features to. As well, we can rewrite the
frontend to make use of newer Javascript libraries to provide a cleaner
and smoother interface.
